## ðŸš€ Getting Started (Kaggle GPU Environment)

To reproduce the results in a **Kaggle Notebook with GPU**, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Kaggle Notebook** at: https://www.kaggle.com/code  
2. **Enable GPU** in the notebook settings (Settings â†’ Accelerator â†’ GPU)  
3. **Clone the repository** in a code cell:

   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/ynhuhu/Hacking-the-Human-Vasculature-in-3D.git
